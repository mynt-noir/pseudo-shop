# Final Project Retrospective

## Team Members
- Student 1: Nuan Patricia S. Serrano
- Student 2: Godfrey Angelo A. Convento

## 1. How did you divide the work between you and your partner?
I worked on features 1 and 2 (user authentication and login, and filter products). While Gelo worked on features 3 and 4 (product management and display storefront). The division of worked was talked about. I asked Gelo if he was okay with taking features 3 and 4, while she took 1 and 2.

## 2. What Git strategies or commands helped you most during the project?
Branching and commiting frequently helped me a lot during the project. With branching, my partner and I were able to work on different features together concurrently. As for committing, it helps create a "save point" for things that you are working on and keeps a record of it so you can easily go back to specific commits if you want to rollback.

## 3. Describe a merge conflict you encountered. What caused it and how did you resolve it?
Gelo and I were working on two different features (filter product and product management) located in the same file. So when we tried to merge, there was a conflict on which code to add. To resolve it, we went on a meeting to talk about the conflict and discussed what to keep and/or discard.

## 4. What were the biggest challenges you faced as a team?
I think it's just the difference in the way we write our code. And since we were working on the features separately, and we only had a meeting once we were all done with our features for the review, we only knew at the end about what our code looks like and its details. So we spent a bit more time, aligning and making sure our code is cohesive.

## 5. What did you learn about using Git in a collaborative setting?
While you can work on things individually because of branches, it is still important to communicate to your teammates to align and make sure that everyone agrees with the changes being made.

## 6. How would you improve your workflow next time?
Remember to commit every now and then. Because I usually just save my code (using CTRL+S) and forget to commit during important stops.

## 7. Optional: Any feedback on the activity?
The activity was good and instructions were well stated.
